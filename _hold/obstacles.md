Even though I'm a huge advocate for using games for training I do think there are a number of obstacles that could hurt rather than help a particular audience.

The bottom line is if the instructor using it is a piece of shit then it doesn't matter how good the game is.  

In other words the instructor and how you use the game is more important than the game itself.


## What are some of the obstacles to using games in PME?
I've been in this business for a long time and the following problems seem to be the most prevalent.

- The instructor
- The game 
  - Using the game in a way it was not intended
  - The game may be too complicated, steep learning curve
- Not knowing how to use the game


### The instructor
- Afraid of the technology, non-gamer
- Does not see the value
- Lazy
- Tactically incompetent, afraid to look stupid.

### The game lacks certain features
- Diffcult for students and instructors to see the results
- Limits the games utility
- Cannot do a proper AAR

###  Not knowing how to use the game or why
- No understanding of how the game fits in the curriculum or program of instruction
- Lack of understanding regarding why the game is being used
- Afraid of technology
  
### Too complicated to learn
- Awkward interface
- Model is too complicated
- Takes too long to learn
- Playing the game is a perishable skill
