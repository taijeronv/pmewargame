In many military learning institutions, the Tactical Decision Exercise or TDE is one of the main tools used to teach tactics. The TDE is simple to set up and can be tailored to meet specific learning outcomes. In places like West Point and ROTC, the TDE has become more of a planning exercise because there is not enough time to include the execution piece.

### TDE Workflow:
1. The instructor gives the student a mission and a map of the operations area.
2. The student writes an operations order (OPORD), a course of action (COA), and creates the appropriate operational graphics on the map.
3. The instructor grades the assignment, but where's the execution?

A typical West Point class is 16 students and lasts for 45 minutes. To execute a mission manually, the instructor must assume the role of "umpire." The umpire performs game functions like resolving combat, movement, spotting, and other tasks. As you can imagine, this takes time. It's challenging to do this for one cadet, let alone 16.

### Execution is important
The execution piece is arguably the most important part of the learning process:
- Opportunities to make decisions in an interactive operational environment.
- Solve problems regarding the enemy, terrain, and weather.
- Ability to practice the same scenario or different scenarios, repetition.
- Make decisions at the appropriate level e.g., platoon, company.

The NGW is meant to provide a quick and easy way for a student to execute their plan. All the student does is issue orders to their units, and the program does the rest.

A computer game manages all the time consuming tasks making it the perfect tool when time is limited.

**Computer Umpire:**
- Sets up the scenario.
- Knows and enforces all the rules.
- Quickly performs game functions.
- Keeps track of everything that takes place in the game.
- Records the game so the student can review it in more detail later.
- It allows the student to practice the same mission as many times as they like allowing them to try different tactics or courses of action.
- Improves student's ability to visualize the operation by showing them how it unfolds.
