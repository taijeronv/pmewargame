The following is a proposal for a computer wargame playable over the internet inside a web browser.  The NextGen Wargame (NGW) is a game designed to be a tool for learning tactics.  It provides an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather all have an effect and enables the player to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.

In many military learning institutions, the Tactical Decision Exercise or TDE is one of the main tools used to teach tactics.  The TDE is simple to set up and can be tailored to meet specific learning outcomes.  In places like West Point and ROTC, the TDE has become more of a planning exercise because there is not enough time to include the execution piece.  

**TDE Workflow:**
1.  The instructor gives the students a mission and a map of the operations area.
2.  The students write an operations order (OPORD), plan a course of action (COA), and draw the appropriate operational graphics on the map.
3.  The instructor grades the assignment.

A typical West Point class is around 16 students and lasts for 45 minutes.  To execute a mission manually, the instructor assumes the role of "umpire." The umpire performs game functions like resolving combat, movement, spotting, and other tasks. As you can see, this takes time.  It's challenging to do this for one cadet, let alone 16.  

The NGW is meant to provide a quick and easy way for a student to execute their plan.  All the student does is issue orders to their units, and the program does the rest.

**Computer Umpire:**
- Sets up the scenario.
- Knows and enforces all the rules.
- Quickly performs game functions.
- Keeps track of everything that takes place in the game.
- Records the game so the student can review it in more detail later.
- It allows the student to practice the same mission as many times as they like allowing them to try different tactics or courses of action.
- Improves student's ability to visualize the operation by showing them how it unfolds.
