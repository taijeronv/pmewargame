One of the things that make this game "NextGen" is that it is delivered over the internet. There is no requirement to install the game on a client computer; everything takes place inside the browser. 

Another benefit of running the game from a remote server is maintainability. Instead of downloading a patch and applying it to several computers, the game is automatically maintained on the server-side, eliminating the need for local maintenance. Likewise, new features can be pushed to the server as they become available. In this way, the program is always up to date.

There are three ways to market the program, subscriptions, custom customcontent, or local installations.

### Subscriptions
Subscriptions offer the most flexibility and can reach the widest audience, both domestically or abroad.

There is nothing to download. The game is self-contained in the browser. All the customer does is register and purchase a subscription.

Subscriptions can be used to give access to specially configured versions of the game or Custom Content. 

### Custom Content
Subscriptions can be configured to access custom content.

Custom content is about creating a complete package that supports specific learning outcomes tailored to the needs of an institution or organization. It also includes teaching clients how to use the material.

An example of custom content would be scenarios created to support ROTC instruction. We take their existing paper-based Tactical Decision Exercises and digitize them as NextGen Wargame scenarios that can be played in the game. 

But that's not all. In addition to the scenarios included in the package are custom graphics, maps, briefings, reports, and instructor's guides.  We help them integrate the digitized scenarios into their lesson plans and guide them in facilitating their use in the classroom.

Keep in mind that academic institutions are just one potential client. Military units or organizations can also benefit from a game like NGW. 

For example, a professional development package could be designed to complement a professional reading list. 

Or maybe a battalion would like to develop their lower-enlisted soldiers (why wait), so they create a small tactics lab of 10 computers.  A special package of content could be designed to support their specific training outcomes.

### Local Install
NGW runs the same, whether it is on the internet or on a LAN.  
A LAN setup requires training on how to manage to update the software.  Fortunately, this can be done remotely for an additional cost.  If maintenance is done on-site, then a system administrator will need to be trained on specific maintenance tasks.
