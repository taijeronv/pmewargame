The NexGen Wargame should take 9-12 months to develop.  NGW is not art intensive, nor is it a heavy-duty simulations model.  Animation and audio effects are minimal and do not require any special techniques or systems to implement.

Special attention will focus on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience. If the game is hard to play, it won't be played. 

The AI and Event system will also be highly specialized and require more development time to get right. A fully functional game engine should be completed within 3-4 months. The remaining time will be spent getting the "specialized systems" developed and tested.

**Phase 1 Development Team**  
1 x Project Leade/Designer  
1 x Javascript Programmer  
1 x Javascript/Frontend Developer  

As the game progresses in complexity, additional members will be added to the team.

**Phase 2 Development Team:**  
1 x Project Lead/Designer  
2 x Javascript Programmers  
1 x Frontend Developer  
1 x Content Creator/Artist  

**Proposed Timeline**  
- 1 month requirements
- 2-3 months proof of principal  
- 3-6 months early demo  
- 6-9 months minimum viable product  
- 9-12 months full production
