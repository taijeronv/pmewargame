The NextGen Wargame (NGW) is a computer game that can be played over the internet, inside a web browser, on Windows, MacOS, or Linux. NGW is designed to model high-intensity conventional land-based operations and has additional features that make it the perfect tool for teaching and learning tactics. 

- Players assume the role of platoon, company, or battalion commanders. 
- They make plans, issue orders, and try to accomplish the mission objectives.

Many games designed for the professional military market are either first-person-shooters or 3d virtual multimedia extravaganzas.

The truth is many of these games are unsuitable for the classroom environment.   They are complicated to play, require high-end hardware, or special gaming skills to play.

Simulations such as JCATS or WARSIM are great exercise drivers but could never work in a classroom environment. They are over-engineered, and learning to operate the sim takes more than an hour to learn (closer to a week).

NGW is designed to provide an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather all have an effect. This is the perfect environment to practice making tactical decisions.
