The NextGen Wargame (NGW) is a computer game that can be played over the internet, inside a web browser, on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.  NGW is designed to model high-intensity conventional land-based operations and can further be used as a tool for teaching and learning tactics.  Players assume the role of platoon, company, or battalion commander's.  They make plans, issues orders, and try to accomplish the mission objectives.

Many games designed for the professional military market are either first-person-shooters, or 3d virtual multimedia extravaganzas.  

The truth is many of these games are unsuitable for the classroom environment because they are too complicated to play, require high-end hardware, or requre gaming skills to play well.  These are all distractors that inhibit learning rather than improve it. 

NGW is designed to provide an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather all have an effect and enables the player to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.
