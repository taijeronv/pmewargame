The following is a proposal for a computer game playable over the internet inside a web browser.  The NextGen Wargame (NGW) is a game designed to be a tool for learning tactics.  Many games designed for the professional military market are either first-person-shooters, or 3d virtual multimedia extravaganzas.  

The truth is many of these games are unsuitable for the classroom environment because they are too complicated to play and require high-end hardware.

NGW is designed to provide an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather all have an effect and enables the player to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.  The game is delivered over the internet making the operating system immaterial.
