The player begins the game by selecting a scenario.  Scenarios are presented on a webpage with a brief summary that provides information about that scenario to help the player decide if they want to play it.

Once the player decides on a scenario they click on the link and the scenario data is loaded into the game.  Scenario information includes unit data, map, terrain, briefings, and reports.  The enemy and friendly units are placed in their initial start positions although the player cannot see the locations of the enemy forces.

In some scenarios the player may be allowed to place their units in different locations but with certain restrictions.

The player also has the option of doing some planning.  The may want to task organize their units based on what they want them to do. 

> The player decides they will task organize in the following manner.  Machinegun team 1 will be attached to 1st Platoon.  The forward observer will move with 2nd Platoon.  The bomb dog will with 3rd Platoon.

The player may also issue orders to their units although they are not obligated too.
> - 1st Platoon move to hill 706 and establish a support by fire position.  
> - 2nd Platoon move to the woods to the north of that farmhouse.  
> - 3rd Platoon stay in your current position but be prepared to move on my orders.  

Orders are issues by using the mouse or keyboard commands.

When the player is satisfied with their plan they may begin the turn by pressing the "Go" or "Play" button.

The umpire calculates everything that takes place like movement, combat, and spotting.  When the calculations are complete the player is notified at which point they can view the turn in a VCR like replay.  They can view the replay as many times as they wish before beginning the next planning and execution.

Now that a turn has been completed the player can make adjustments to their plans, issue new orders, or let the units complete their currently assigned orders.

The scenario is complete when the player chooses to surrender, or the computer umpire determines certain conditions have been met.
