The player begins by selecting a scenario. Scenarios are presented on a webpage with a brief summary that helps the player decide which one to play.

The player chooses a scenario and clicks on its link, which loads it into the game.

A more detailed briefing is presented along with the units, and reports about the enemy and terrain.

Enemy and friendly units are placed in their initial start positions (specified in the scenario file). In some scenarios, the player may be allowed to "magic move" their units to a different location, within certain restrictions.

Before the player beings the first turn, they have the opportunity to do some planning, rearrange their units (task organize), and issue orders.

The player may also issue orders to their units, although they are not obligated too.
> - 1st Platoon move to hill 706 and establish a support by fire position.
> - 2nd Platoon move to the woods to the north of that farmhouse.
> - 3rd Platoon stays in your current location, but be prepared to move on my orders.

Orders are issues by using the mouse or keyboard commands.

When the player is satisfied with their plan, they may begin the turn by pressing the "Go" or "Play" button.

Once the turn starts, the umpire starts to execute unit orders in addition to other game functions. The player watches the entire turn as the action unfolds. 

When the turn is over, the player can go back and review a replay as many times as they like. This is invaluable because it allows the player to analyze what's going on. They see the impact of their decisions and gain a more thorough understanding of the situation.

Playing the game follows the same pattern:  
1. Plan.
2. Execute a turn.
3. Replay and analyze.
The game is complete when the player chooses to surrender, or the computer umpire determines certain conditions have been met.
