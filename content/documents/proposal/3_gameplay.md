The player begins the game by selecting a scenario.  Scenarios are presented on a webpage with a brief summary that gives provides the player information to help them decide if they want to play a particular scenario.

1.  The player decides on a scenario to play and clicks the link.  Another page opens with an instance of the game and more detailed information regarding the situation.
2.  The player does some planning, issues orders, and organizes their forces.  In some scenarios, they may be allowed to reposition their units.
3.  Once they are satisfied, they press the "Go" button, and the turn executes.
4.  The computer umpire or "umpire" performs game tasks, makes calculations, and executes the turn.
5.  The player is notified that the turn is complete and presses the play button to see what happened.  They can spend as much time as they like reviewing the results of the turn.
6.  The player issues new orders to their units, and presses "Go" to execute another turn.
7.  Repeat steps 1-4 until the umpire determines a winner.

A "turn" consists of two or three phases and represents a variable amount of actual time anywhere from 5-15 minutes.  Each phase has a pre-determined set of actions that can be performed, provided specific criteria are met.  

The scenario is complete when the player chooses to surrender, or the computer umpire determines certain conditions have been met.
