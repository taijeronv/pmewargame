The NextGen Wargame puts the player in the role of a platoon, company, or battalion commander.  

Before the game begins, the player is given information regarding the task, friendly forces, enemy, terrain, and time available. The player creates a course of action and attempts to execute it in the game.  To win, they must accomplish the scenario's mission objectives.

The entire operation takes place on a 2d image that represents a military topographic map.  The map is produced using a commercial program like Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.  

Player's use the mouse and keyboard commands to issue orders to their units.  They must decide how to organize their forces, employ weapon systems, and assign tasks to their units while taking into account the effects of the terrain and weather. 

Events can be added to a scenario to force students into specific decision-making situations.  For example, an event may be triggered whenever one of the player's units enters a specific location.  

A Scenario Designer works closely with the instructor to create a scenario that meets the lessons learning outcomes.  The scenario designer also creates content like the map, unit data, and the instructor's guide.  

The game ends when one side or the other accomplishes their mission or their forces become too weak to continue.  At the end of each turn, the computer umpire determines if either condition has been met.
