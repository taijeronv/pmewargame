The NextGen Wargame is a computer game that is designed to be a learning tool for tactics.  Its purpose is to provide the student an operational enviroment where they can execute their plans. 

- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- It is NOT a first-person-shooter nor is it a 3d virtual reality game.

If you have any experience with Army simulations like [JCATS](https://csl.llnl.gov/jcats) or [WARSIM](https://www.defensedaily.com/lockheed-martins-warsim-debuts-in-division-exercise-2/uncategorized/) you know what I mean by **"easy to play and understand."**

## Is it a game or simulation?
Take a look at these two articles for some light-reading on the difference between games and sims.  
[Games vs Simulations: Choosing the Right Approach for Learning](http://www.theknowledgeguru.com/games-vs-simulations-choosing-right-approach/)  
[Sims vs. Games: The Difference Defined](https://www.edutopia.org/sims-vs-games)

For a more academic read take a look at this one:  
[Distinguishing between games and simulations: A systematic review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9af/13efe8f58fbde49423534f86fffffb8f16e1.pdf)

NGW has elements of both.

## Vignettes
To get an idea of what NGW is designed for take a look at [Mastering Tactics by Major John F. Schmitt, USMCR](https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/Mastering-Tactics.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3AdL0ytebQyvmXptlXfoQP7IxYWa6JUhsX96TnYmljvA59AJ6qduKnoVI).
