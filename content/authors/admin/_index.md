The NextGen Wargame is a computer wargame that provides the student with an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.  It enables the student to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.

- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- It is NOT a first-person-shooter, nor is it a 3d virtual reality game.

In many Professional Military Education (PME) programs the Tactical Decision Exercise or TDE is the main tool used to teach tactics.  Institutions like West Point and ROTC mainly use it as a planning exercise with little to no opportunity for a cadet to execute their plan.  It's not that they think planning is more important, the problem is lack of time.

In a typical West Point class, you may have up to 16 students and 45 minutes for a lesson.  There's not enough time to execute one cadet's plan, let alone 16.  

### Execution 
The execution piece is arguably the most important part of the TDE because the student must make decisions based on their understanding of the situation, interact with the operational environment, solve problems, and apply a solution.  

It also helps the instructor identify gaps in the student's knowledge, in addition to how well the student applies that knowledge.  The instructor can then calibrate their thinking and further develop the students tactical IQ.

Simply playing NGW doesn't mean much, but reviewing the game "footage" afterwards means everything.  This is when the real learning takes place.

- Identify key decisions and how they affected the outcome of the mission.
- Link their decisions to their understanding of the situation at the time.
- Determine what they could have done better during execution or planning.
- Re-play the mission and apply what they learned.

{{% alert note %}}
NGW is designed to provide a quick and easy execution component that supplements the paper-based TDE.  It is NOT meant to replace it.

**A properly designed computer wargame offers:**  
- A quick way to execute a course of action.  
- A dynamic and interactive environment that forces the student to make realistic decisions.  
- The ability to tailor a scenario to meet specific learning outcomes using "Events."
- The ability to record everything that happens in the game and play it back.
- A simple user interface and flat learning curve.
- A more interesting way to learn.
