The NextGen Wargame is a computer wargame that provides the student with an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect. It enables the student to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.

- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- It is NOT a first-person-shooter, nor is it a 3d virtual reality game.

In many Professional Military Education (PME) programs, the Tactical Decision Exercise or TDE is the primary tool used to teach tactics. Institutions like West Point and ROTC mainly use it as a planning exercise with little to no opportunity for a cadet to execute their plan. It's not that they think planning is more important, the problem is lack of time.

In a typical West Point class, you may have up to 16 students and 45 minutes for a lesson. There's not enough time to execute one cadet's plan, let alone 16.

### Execution
The execution piece is the most important part of the TDE. Why? Because this is when the student makes decisions based on their understanding of the situation, interact with the operational environment, solve problems, and apply a solution.

It also allows the instructor to assess the student's ability to apply what they've been taught or identify gaps in the student's knowledge. The instructor can then calibrate their thought process, improving their ability to think.

The student doesn't learn anything by only playing the game. The real learning takes place when the student can review what they did during the game. An instructor is there to facilitate learning. You see, it's the instructor that does the teaching, not the game.

{{% alert note %}}
NGW is NOT meant to replace the paper-based TDE. NGW is meant to provide a quick and easy execution component in an interactive operational environment.
