The NestGen Wargame or NGW is designed to be easy to play, portable, and playable in a web browser. 

NGW is more of a game than a simulation.  Why do I consider it so? Because it will be easy to play and understand.

If you have any experience with Army simulations like [JCATS](https://csl.llnl.gov/jcats) or [WARSIM](https://www.defensedaily.com/lockheed-martins-warsim-debuts-in-division-exercise-2/uncategorized/) you know what I mean by **"easy to play and understand."**

## Is it a game or simulation?
Take a look at these two article for some light-reading on the difference between games and sims.  
[Games vs Simulations: Choosing the Right Approach for Learning](http://www.theknowledgeguru.com/games-vs-simulations-choosing-right-approach/)  
[Sims vs. Games: The Difference Defined](https://www.edutopia.org/sims-vs-games)

For a more academic read take a look at this one:  
[Distinguishing between games and simulations: A systematic review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9af/13efe8f58fbde49423534f86fffffb8f16e1.pdf)

NGW has elements of both.

## The NextGen Wargame is NOT an Exercise Driver!
The exercise driver is used as the "execution" component in a staff exercise.
Typically staff exercises are more about staff processes and planning, and not
execution. But to make a plan you need some kind of inputs or outcomes
to use in the process. This is what the exercise driver or simulation provides.

In most cases the staff never sees the game, it stays behind the "curtain."  
Exercise control runs the game or simulation many "turns" as necessary to get to
a point that satisfies some learning outcome. 

For example the instructor's may want the students to do a river crossing or
breach so the game is run until they get to that point. Students are given the
"outputs" from the simulation and use them for the next planning cycle. Rinse
and repeat til the exercise is complete.

Exercise driver is not a suitable use case for NGW because it lacks a detailed
model which is somewhat of a requirement. While NGW will model many of the war
fighting functions it is done in a more abstract way.

## How does NGW work?
NGW is meant to support learning in the classroom. 

In most learning institutions paper based Tactical Decision Exercises/Games
(TDE/TDG) are used as a the main way to engage the students. A basic TDE consists of a scenario/vignette
and a map. 

The student creates a course of action using the information given in the
scenario and turns it into a "graphics" COA on the map. This is how we did it
at West Point. NGW can be used in the same way but instead of just planning, the
student gets to execute their COA.

## Why is executing the operation so important?
Results.

What happened during the operation.  Did you account for the enemy on hill 706? How effective was your mortar fire and was it on the right target?.  Your platoon was delayed due to enemy fire was it because of their route? Was there a better route option?

NGW allows you to execute the mission and play it back.  Imagine watching a sports replay on TV, that's the kind of play-back I'm talking about.  Now, watching the replay you can answer all those questions, on your own.  Can you imagine the kind of learning that takes place by simply analyzing the replay?

- What went right/wrong and WHY.
- What adjustments do you need to make to be successful? Explain the impact of those adjustments.
- Did the scenario provide enough information to make good decisions? If not
  then what additional information do you need?
- Is the extra information you need obtainable by you or does HQ need to
  provide this information?
- How would you submit those RFIs to your HQ?

## What does a vignette look like?
I'll do you one better.  Instead of explaining to you take a look at [Mastering Tactics by Major John F. Schmitt, USMCR](https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/Mastering-Tactics.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3AdL0ytebQyvmXptlXfoQP7IxYWa6JUhsX96TnYmljvA59AJ6qduKnoVI).
