The NestGen Wargame or NGW is designed to be easy to play, portable, and playable in a web browser. 

NGW is more of a game than a simulation.  Why do I consider it so? Because it will be easy to play and understand.

If you have any experience with Army simulations like [JCATS](https://csl.llnl.gov/jcats) or [WARSIM](https://www.defensedaily.com/lockheed-martins-warsim-debuts-in-division-exercise-2/uncategorized/) you know what I mean by **"easy to play and understand."**

# What is the difference between a game and simulation?
Take a look at these two article for some light-reading on the difference between games and sims.  
[Games vs Simulations: Choosing the Right Approach for Learning](http://www.theknowledgeguru.com/games-vs-simulations-choosing-right-approach/)  
[Sims vs. Games: The Difference Defined](https://www.edutopia.org/sims-vs-games)

For a more academic read take a look at this one:  
[Distinguishing between games and simulations: A systematic review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9af/13efe8f58fbde49423534f86fffffb8f16e1.pdf)

# The NextGen Wargame is NOT an Exercise Driver!
NGW is not designed to drive an exercise, nor would anyone want to make it do so.

An exercise driver is a program that is used to for outputs. Rather than have a
white-cell provide outputs a simulation is used. The outputs from the sim are
fed to a staff group. The staff groups uses those outputs for the next planning
cycle. This is what we mean by "driver" it fuels the staff process with outputs
they can use to conduct planning.

On the other hand NGW has a narrower focus and lacks some of the detail you may want in an excercise driver.  

>For example NGW will not be designed with a detailed logistics model.
