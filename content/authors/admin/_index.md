The NextGen Wargame is a computer game that provides the student with an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.  It enables the student to practice making decisions in a tactical environment.

- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- It is NOT a first-person-shooter, nor is it a 3d virtual reality game.

The paper-based Tactical Decision Game (TDG) is one of the tools used by institutions like [West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/) or [ROTC](https://www.todaysmilitary.com/education-training/rotc-programs) to teach tactics.  

One of the problems with paper TDGs is the cadet doesn't get the opportunity to execute their plan.

Why? Not enough time. In a typical West Point class you may have up to 16 students and 45 minutes for a class.  There's not enough time to execute one cadets plan let alone 16.  Execution is essential because this is where the student gets to make decisions and solve problems.

NGW isn't meant to replace the TDG. It is intended to bring it to life by providing the student an opportunity to execute their plan in an operational environment, in a timely manner.  Computer wargames are fast and easy to set up (if appropriately designed), which makes NGW the perfect complement to paper TDGs.
