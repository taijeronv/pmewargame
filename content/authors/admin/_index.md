# Philosophy
The NextGen Wargame (NGW) is based on my time at West Point observing cadets
play "Follow Me" and "Virtual Battlespace."

But it wasn't just the cadets I observed it was also the instructors and senior leadership
in my department.

I learned a few things:
- The most important part of the equation besides the game itself, is the
  instructors. You absolutely need an instructor in the loop, the game is simply
  a tool it does not teach the student anything.
- You WILL need an expert on the game on hand to do some hand holding when
  necessary. Whether it's developing content or teaching the faculty how to use
  the game you will need someone who inspires confidence in the program and
  has the technical ability in all aspects of the game.
- Support from senior leadership is important, this goes without saying.
- Senior leadership is willing to listen to the "right" experts. I put "right"
  in quotes because more often than not the so-called-expert whispering in the
  ear of the senior leadership isn't really an expert.
- If the game is too hard to play then it has no place in the classroom. Time is
  precious and the game is NOT why students are there. They are there to learn,
  not to learn to play the game.
- The game needs to "look" right. For example the map should look like an actual
  military topo map, not a map overlaid with a hex grid.

Here are some characteristics:
- Easy to play
- Easy to explain
- Customizable content that doesn't require specialized skills
- Designed by gamers with military experience, that have taught in the
  classroom, and have used a game as part of the curriculum (this is a rare
  breed)
