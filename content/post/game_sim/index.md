## Is it a game or simulation?
Take a look at these two articles for some light-reading on the difference between games and sims.  
[Games vs Simulations: Choosing the Right Approach for Learning](http://www.theknowledgeguru.com/games-vs-simulations-choosing-right-approach/)  
[Sims vs. Games: The Difference Defined](https://www.edutopia.org/sims-vs-games)

For a more academic read take a look at this one:  
[Distinguishing between games and simulations: A systematic review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9af/13efe8f58fbde49423534f86fffffb8f16e1.pdf)

NGW has elements of both.
