If you have the right game there is a very simple way to overcome instructor anxiety.  The bonus is it's a very good method for teaching tactics.

I'm talking about a simple AAR replay.

## How does it work?
The idea is really simple.

The student watches an AAR replay of a game that has already been played.  The AAR could be created by the instructor or it could be a replay from a student.

The idea is for the student to analyze the replay then critique it as if they were doing an AAR.

## Why is this easymode?
It's easy for the instructor and the student because they do not have to play the game.  All they is watch the replay then write a short critique.

In a previous article I made the point that the instructor is the weakest link when it comes to using games in the classroom.  There are many reasons why but the most important ones would be anxiety of the technology and not knowing how to play.

This method eliminates both those fears.  

## What does the student get out of it?
The student gets to see what good or bad looks like.

The beauty is whomever makes the AAR file can decide what amount of right or wrong is incorporated in the final product.  

For example if you wanted to create where the player has several options to choose from regarding routes.  From this scenario you could create an AAR file for each route which highlights its strengths and weaknesses.  This allows the student to compare and contrast.

## How do you create the AAR file?
If the game you're using has the ability to record what the players doing then you are half way there.  The ideal situation is for the game to record everything that takes place, then it allows you to replay it with the normal "VCR" controls like pause, fastforward, or reverse.

If the game allows you to play both sides then it's even more powerful.  In this way you can control 100% of what's going on.  You control where the units move, how units react to enemy, etc.

Basically you are "programming" the AAR based on the student's learning objectives.
