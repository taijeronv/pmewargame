I love using computer games to teach tactics. When I was at West Point I got the
opportunity to assist in the development of a game which was designed to teach
tactical decision-making and problem solving.

The most common way to teach tactics was to use a paper-based Tactical Decision
Exercise (TDE) sometimes referred to as a Tactical Decision Game (TDG). The
cadet was given a problem which they were supposed to "solve." The TDE was
basically a writing assignment, the cadet would right an OPORD and submit a
sketch of the map with their course of action represented by military graphics.
The instructor would grade their solution and provide feedback.

## What's missing?
For the most part the paper-based TDE was an ok way to teach tactics but I couldn't help but think there was a better way.

So what exactly did the cadets learn from solving that TDE? In my opinion whatever it is they learned was incomplete.

Sure they could write a five-paragraph OPORD and draw some graphics on a map but
did they really understand their own solution? More importantly could they
really explain they "whys" behind their decisions. 


### Why should I use a computer game for PME?

- Provides feedback based on the student's decisions
- Allows the student to interact with the operational environment
- The student may try different tactics or courses of action
- Provides the student with the opportunity to conduct a detailed AAR by reviewing the entire game

### Why is feedback important regarding decisions?
- Feedback allows the student to see the results of their decision
- Feedback offers context
  
### Why is it important for the student to interact with the operational environment?
- Allows them to experience a real threat, the enemy
- Enable them to experience the effects of weather
- Enable them to experience the effects of terrain


### Why is it important for the student to try different tactics and courses of action?
- Allows the student to try different tactics in a non-threatening environment
- Allows the student to try different plans
- The ability to compare and contrast is important for understanding

### Deliberate practice
- Quality practice makes perfect
- Set goals.  Becoming an expert involves small setps with gradually increasing difficulty or challenges.
- Practice regularly.  Many warfighting skills are perishable.  In this case we are talking about improving your mind, your tatical intellect so to speak.
- Track your progress.  This may be more subjective than anything.  You may need to engage in other activities to truly gauge where you are.
