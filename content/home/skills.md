[[feature]]
icon = "photo-video"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Visualization"
description = """  
A picture is worth a thousand words or so the saying goes. The ability to see
your plan come to life is invaluable. It adds a dimension that you cannot get
with a paper-based TDE."""

[[feature]]
icon = "comments"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Feedback"
description = """  
It's important for the student to get some feedback regarding their decisions.
For example if the student chose a route that exposes their unit to enemy fire
they should know about it. Typically this happens when the enemy fires on your
unit.  Feedback is important.  
"""  

[[feature]]
icon = "flask"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Experimentation"
description = """  
Imagine the learning that takes place when the student is able to compare
different courses of action or try different tactics. Making mistakes is part
of the learning process, NGW allows the student to try different things in a
risk free environment."""

[[feature]]
icon = "cloud-sun-rain"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Operational Environment"
description = """  
Arguably the most important benefit is the ability to operate in an
operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.  
"""

[[feature]]
icon = "desktop"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Easy Interface"
description = """  
If the game you're using is too hard to play then you're using the wrong game.
NGW is simple to play and easy to understand. Your students are not in class
to learn the game. The game is meant to be a tool which means it should not
interfere with learning."""

[[feature]]
icon = "puzzle-piece"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Simple Model"
description = """  
There is no requirement for a highly detailed model. NGW uses a simple model
that abstractly models all of the warfighting functions. """  

[[feature]]
icon = "ban"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "OS Agnostic"
description = """  
Linux, Mac, or Windows it doesn't matter what OS you're running NGW runs in
your web browser. You will not need an army of contractors to maintain the
program or create content. You will not need expensive hardware."""

[[feature]]
icon = "ban"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Content"
description = """  
Content should be easy enough to create in-house. In other words you shouldn't
need a specially trained contractor to create content for you. Graphics in NGW
can be easily created with a paint program and a drawing program (yes they are
different). Data for the program is created by one of the unit editor which is
part of the game."""

[[feature]]
icon = "question-circle"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Tactical Decision-Making"
description = """  
Do you think it's important that students learning tactics be given the
opportunity to think? Of course you do. Playing in an interactive environment
means the students are confronted with problems they may not have planned for.
Imagine how much learning takes place when they are given the opportunity to
think their way out of a problem. """

[[feature]]
icon = "users"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Users"
description = """  
Students enrolled in a military program, instructors who want to provide a
complete learning experience, military professionals who want to stay sharp,
commanders who want their soldiers to be tactically proficient, these are the
users.  NGW is about exercising minds and increasing tactical IQ."""
