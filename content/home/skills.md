icon = "users"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Users"
description = """  
The target audience for NGW are students, instructors, and military professionals.  Give your students the best possible experiential learning experience or provide opportunities for your unit members to practice their craft."""

[[feature]]
icon = "cloud-sun-rain"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Operational Environment"
description = """  
Arguably the most crucial benefit is the ability to operate in an environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.  The enemy shoots back, the terrain affects cover and concealment, and the weather limits air operations. 
"""

[[feature]]
icon = "question-circle"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Tactical Decision-Making"
description = """  
What's more important learning how to think or learning what to think? Playing in an interactive environment means the students are confronted with problems they may not have planned for.  In NGW students must learn to think their way out of a problem. """

[[feature]]
icon = "photo-video"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Visualization"
description = """  
A picture is worth a thousand words, or so the saying goes. NGW brings to life the paper TDG. Observe your units moving and fighting, see the enemy, master the
terrain.  Learn to visualize."""

[[feature]]
icon = "comments"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Feedback"
description = """  
Feedback regarding their decisions is essential. For example, if the student chose a route that exposes their unit to enemy fire, they should know about it. Typically this happens when the enemy fires on your unit.  
"""  

[[feature]]
icon = "flask"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Experimentation"
description = """  
Imagine the learning that takes place when the student can compare different courses of action or try different tactics. Making mistakes is part of the learning process. NGW allows the student to try different things in a risk-free environment."""

[[feature]]
icon = "desktop"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Easy Interface"
description = """  
If the game you're using is too hard to play, then you're using the wrong game.  NGW is simple to play and easy to understand. Your students are not in class to learn how to play a game."""

[[feature]]
icon = "ban"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "OS Agnostic"
description = """  
Linux, Mac, or Windows, it doesn't matter what OS you're running NGW runs in your web browser. It doesn't require an army of contractors or expensive hardware."""

[[feature]]
icon = "palette"
icon_pack = "fas"
name = "Content"
description = """  
Content should be easy to create in-house. Graphics in NGW can be easily created with a paint program and a drawing program (yes, they are different). Unit data is created using a unit editor, included with the game."""
